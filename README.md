# DFESW13-Pokemon

Created by Nick Ciraki

## Why am I doing this?
This project is the culmination of my 9 week software development course with QA, utilising the skills I've learnt in Java and MySQL.\
The idea behind this project came from interest my in video games, but I also had inspiration from my nephew who had recenetly started\
played the video game franchise himself.

## How did I expect this challenge to go?
